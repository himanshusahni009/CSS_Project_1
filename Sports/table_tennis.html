					Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a
					sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball,
					also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a
					table using small rackets. Table tennis is governed by the
					worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation
					(ITTF), founded in 1926. The game takes place on a hard
					table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the
					rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball
					played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the
					table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite
					side at least once. The game is popular all over the world.
					In most countries it is very highly organized as a
					competitive sport, especially in Europe and Asia,
					particularly in China and Japan. Table tennis improves
					reflex, eye-hand coordination, mental alertness and speed of
					movement. It also improves balance and lowers the chances of
					falls and injuries. Additionally, table tennis is a safe
					sport to play because it is not a contact sport. It is easy
					on the body and can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
