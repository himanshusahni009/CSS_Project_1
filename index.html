					HTML5 is a mark-up language used for structuring and
					presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth
					and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web
					Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification
					is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by a
					consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google,
					Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application
					Technology Working Group (WHATWG). HTML5 was first released
					in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008. Its goals were
					to improve the language with support for the latest
					multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both
					easily readable by humans and consistently understood by
					computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc.,
					without XHTML rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible
					with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only
					HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

					Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used
					for describing the presentation of a document written in a
					mark-up language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone
					technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
					JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of
					presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
					fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility,
					provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
					presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to
					share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
					separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition
					in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file
					to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
					pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of
					formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the
					same markup page in different styles for different rendering
					methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
					speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
					tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting
					if the content is accessed on a mobile device. The name
					cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
					determine which style rule applies if more than one rule
					matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme
					is predictable. In addition to HTML, other mark-up languages
					support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and
					XUL.
