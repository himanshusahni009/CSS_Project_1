					Sport (or sports) is all forms of usually competitive
					physical activity which, through casual or organized
					participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical
					ability and skills while providing entertainment to
					participants, and in some cases, spectators. <br /><br />
					Sport is generally recognized as activities which are based
					in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the
					largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games
					admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other
					organizations such as the Council of Europe using
					definitions precluding activities without a physical element
					from classification as sports.
